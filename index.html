<!-- Create the scene by adding an <a-scene> element inside the <body> element: -->

<!-- A sky box is a background for the 3D world, represented by an <a-sky> element.
In our case we will use a simple color, but it could also be an image, etc. -->

<!-- A cube element

It contains a few parameters already defined: color, position and rotation — 
these are fairly obvious, and define the base color of the cube, the position inside the 3D scene, and the rotation of the cube.

Note: The distance values (e.g. for the cube y position) are unitless, and can basically be 
anything you deem suitable for your scene — milimeters, meters, feet, or miles — it's up to you. -->

    <a-scene>
        <a-sky color="#DDDDDD"></a-sky>
